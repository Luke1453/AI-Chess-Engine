# AI-Chess-Engine

Neural-network based chess engine that runs as flask web-app in users’ browser.
this was a college project that was developed to help grasp the concepts of convolutional neural network and how they can be used. 
In addition to that it serwed as an exercise in writing some Front-End code.

## The goal of the project

The goal of the project was to learn and explore how to create, train, and use convolutional neural networks
by using one to create playable chess engine.

## Project requirements

- User should be able to play chess in the browser.
- Chess engine evaluation function should use convolutional neural network for board state evaluation.

## Technologies used

Project was created using Python 3.8 fallowing libraries were used:

- Python-chess – was used to simplify the creation of the engine.
- Flask – this web framework was used to enable playing chess with the computer in the browser.
- PyTorch – was used to create and train the convolutional neural network used in evaluation function.
